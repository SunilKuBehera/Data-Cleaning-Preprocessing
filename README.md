# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This project focuses on essential techniques and implementations for cleaning and preprocessing raw data before analysis or modeling. The code here demonstrates best practices for preparing datasets, ensuring data quality, and enabling robust downstream analytics.

## Key Features

- **Handling Missing Values:**  
  Techniques for detecting, imputing, or removing missing data using statistical and ML-based approaches.

- **Outlier Detection & Treatment:**  
  Identification and handling of anomalous records to reduce noise and improve dataset integrity.

- **Data Type Conversion:**  
  Automated conversion of columns to appropriate types (numeric, categorical.) for consistency.

- **Categorical Variable Encoding:**  
  One-hot encoding, label encoding, and custom encoding strategies to transform categorical features for ML models.

- **Normalization & Scaling:**  
  Methods to standardize data ranges by Standardization

- **Duplicate Removal:**  
  Efficient detection and elimination of duplicate rows to maintain clean datasets.

### Uses
**Empowering your data science workflow through clean and reliable data.**
